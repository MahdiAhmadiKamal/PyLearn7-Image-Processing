# Histogram Equalization âœ¨
[Histogram equalization](https://docs.opencv.org/4.7.0/d5/daf/tutorial_py_histogram_equalization.html) usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the image is represented by a narrow range of intensity values.

## How to Install
Run following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
Execute these commands in terminal:
```
python histogram_equalization.ipynb
```
```
python CLAHE.ipynb
```

## Results
Left images are **inputs** and right ones are **output** images after histogram equalization.

### 1. Histogram Equalization Results

## Python
This program is written using [Python](https://www.python.org/) language and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), whick is a library of programming functions for real-time computer vision, image processing, and machine learning.
