# Image Encryption and Decryption üîê
**Image Encryption** is the process of converting a normal image into a cipher image using a secret key in such a way that unauthorized users can't access it.
**Image Decryption** is the process of converting the cipher image into the original image by employing the secret key. Mainly, decryption operation is like encryption operation but applies in reverse order.

## How to Install
Run following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
Execute this command in terminal:
```
python encryptor.py
```
```
python decryptor.py
```
